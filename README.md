Intro: 
Connect 4 is a classic game Where 2 player tries to place their color 4 times consicutively  on the board.(Horizontaly or vertically or digonally)
Here I am tring to recreate that game but in console.

Game Play: 
It is a turned based game and starts with Red player and then followed by yellow player.
Choose a column and your color token will be dropped on that column and if there are any empty place on that coloumn. Then that token will be placed there.

Rules:
Try to place your color 4 times consicutively  on the board.(Horizontaly or vertically or digonally)
Before your completion if other player is going to win you can stop him from doing so.
If all the place on the board are filled then it will be draw.
